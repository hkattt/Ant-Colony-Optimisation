# Ant Colony Optimisation
Visualises the ant colony optimisation algorithm for the travelling salesman problem. The program simply displays the current best path found by the algorithm. 

# Instructions
To start running the algorithm simply press the start button on the screen. If you wish to stop running the algorithm press the stop button on the screen. If you want to generate a new graph press the generate button once the algorithm is paused.

# Requirements
This project used Pygame and Numpy. After creating a virtual environment in your desired directory run the following command in your shell: \
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

This project was heavily inspired by Sebastian Lauge's video on [Ant and Slime Simulations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-iSQQgOd1A). I also watched this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfD5xlEcmuQ) by Gopal Prasad Malakar to gain a better understanding of the algorithm. Some papers discussing the algorithm have been listed below:
